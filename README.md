# Harmodulum

Harmodulum is an interactive harmonic pendulum simulation project implemented in JavaScript. It provides a visual and potentially auditory experience of pendulum motion with adjustable physics parameters.

## Features

- Simulate multiple pendulums simultaneously
- Adjust various pendulum properties:
  - Size
  - Arm length
  - Air resistance
  - Velocity
  - Acceleration
  - Damping
- Visual representation of pendulum motion
- Note generation based on pendulum properties
- Physics-based simulation including gravity, angular velocity, and energy calculations

## Files

- `code/harmo_pendulum.js`: Main implementation of the harmonic pendulum simulation
- `code/jsui-over.js`: UI-related code for the project
- `code/testss.js`: Test cases or experimental code

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ostinsolo/Harmodulum.git
   ```
2. Ensure you have the necessary environment set up (e.g., Max/MSP or compatible JavaScript runtime)
3. Load the main script (`harmo_pendulum.js`) into your environment

## Usage

(Add specific instructions on how to run and interact with the simulation, including any necessary software or plugins)
